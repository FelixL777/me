TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In set2, I mainly learned the conversion of alphabetical lists and the use of loop functions. I have a better understanding of Python syntax. Since I have never been exposed to it, I would like to know more about these function codes and how to use them more flexibly.
