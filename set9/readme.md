TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I mainly took quizzes in class, which helped me consolidate the previous knowledge. I am glad that I can understand the data codes I learned earlier, especially those in pandas and maps, which made the content of the quiz less difficult for me.
