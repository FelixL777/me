TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I mainly learned how to make maps. The main focus was on how to process geospatial data, especially how to obtain and use Shapefile data through different file paths and URLs. Shapefile is a common geographic data format, widely used in map making and geographic analysis. And I learned that python can directly extract the contents of a compressed package without having to decompress it before opening it, which is a very simple function. Because now many software require files to be decompressed before they can be accessed.
And the chart production is mainly divided into .hist() histograms and .plot() drawing codes. For me, I think .plot() is more practical and flexible because it can generate many types of graphics.
